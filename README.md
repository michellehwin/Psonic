# Psonic

Psonic is a password manager, equipped with password generation and encrypted storage. I know, doesn't sound very unique so far. What makes Psonic different from (read, superior to) any other password manager is its mnemonic generating capabilities. Unlike similar software, Psonic is designed to help you remember your important passwords on your own, so you can easily log into whatever you must *without* having to open the program every time, while still maintaining the security of a randomly generated password. Not sure exactly what this means? Here's an example:

``u0mPhP.arLE&S! ---> "unbearable zero-mouthed Patricks hate Pontiacs. armies repair Lithuanian Esthers and Saturns!"``

With mnemonics, we are able to turn the jumbled mess of characters that is "u0mPhP.arLE&S!" into something that is much easier on the eyes, and more importantly, much more memorable (the absurdity helps!). We are able to perform such transformations thanks to our state of the art mnemonic generation algorithm. In fact, our algorithm is unrivaled in sophistication, making it **the most advanced mnemonic generation algorithm in the world** (when it comes to variability of input). Don't believe me? Go check out our competitors. Most tools you find will be limited to the twenty-six lowercase letters of the alphabet, and none will be able to handle letters (both cases), numbers, and special characters combined. This fact means that Psonic is the *only* mnemonic program capable of processing truly secure passwords.

## How we built it
Psonic is built with Electron, which is a framework that allows you to use web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop desktop applications. It also relies on other node.js modules such as *lodash* and *list modules*.
